# This is a ToDo List

## Overall

1.  Make the sentence in all documents agree in each other. i.e. use "we will..." instead of "you will..."



## BrightnessAnalogIn.md

1. in this file, the circuit graphic should be change. The led Light lacks a resistor.

2. there's no red line in the graphics showing the duty cycle in Instruction

3. Not understanding what it means in Instruction

>Correspondingly, analogIn's `readRawValue()` is not called this time, but the corresponding return value range of readPercent() is 0 to 1.

>In our opinion, motion blurs each LED flashing into a line. As the LED fades in and out, the length of these thin lines will increase and decrease. Now you will see the pulse width.
