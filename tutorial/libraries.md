# Libraries

## Install a library

Libraries make your coding process more easily. With different libraries, you can control many modules using some simple methods. ‌ ‌

Now let's learn how to install a library.

1.First, download the library from Github. ‌ I'll take the library MadSHT3x for example.

2.Enter the MadSHT3x. Select **Code** &gt; **Download ZIP**.
